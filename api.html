    <h1>API Key Information</h1>
    <h2>What is my API Key?</h2>
    <p>Pokefarm Q allows you to generate an API key to access <b>read only</b> information about your account via their API.</p>
    <h2>How do I generate it?</h2>
    <p>You can find your API key <a href="https://pokefarm.com/farm#tab=5.7">here.</a> You'll have to generate a new one if you don't already have one.</p>
    <p class="footnote">Anybody with access to this key can access read-only information about your account. Generate a new one if you're worried about it.</p>
    <h2>What do you do with my API Key?</h2>
    <p>All this site does is request your boost information from Pokefarm Q directly.
        <br/>Things like whether you have Hypermode, your Albino Radar level, your current chain, and more.
    </p>
    <p>This site does <b>not</b> store your API Key in any way; it's only used to get information when you press the calculate button.</p>
